1) Taking a photo (make_a_photo.py)
2) Collecting points from live-view and write it by hand in txt file(getting_points_by_video_with_coordinates.py and points.txt)
3) Showing points(show_points_on_image.py)
4) Drawing taken points on images (draw_points_on_image.py)
5) Function to get an points from given file (read_points_from_file.py)
6) Make history of photos (history.py)
7) Take an colors from photo (colors.py)


I ended on:

In workfile hello.py I start write an whole colorpicking alghoritm.
Now I made an point's getting part of code...
and I'm focused on photo's history code.

In main.py I start write an whole colorpicking alghoritm.
Now I made an history
and I go for making an new photo.

Photo - made.

Colors picking form photo - check.

Now I'm focused on assigning picked colors to lists, and right transformations for cube permutations.
